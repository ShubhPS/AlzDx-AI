## Features
### **1. ResNet50-Based Dementia Classification**
NeuroScan uses a ResNet50 deep learning model trained on high-quality datasets to classify brain imaging data into four categories:
- **No Dementia**: Normal brain activity without signs of cognitive decline.
- **Very Mild Dementia**: Subtle symptoms indicating early-stage cognitive impairment.
- **Mild Dementia**: Noticeable cognitive decline affecting daily activities.
- **Moderate Dementia**: Significant impairments requiring assistance in daily tasks.

This multi-class classification ensures precise predictions for early intervention.

---

### **2. Secure Login System**
NeuroScan offers a secure login interface with two options:
- **Standard Login**: Username and password-based authentication.
- **Third-Party Authentication**: Integration with Google and GitHub for seamless access.

This ensures secure access to sensitive patient data while maintaining ease of use.

---

### **3. User-Friendly Dashboard**
The dashboard provides healthcare professionals with:
- Easy upload options for MRI scans or imaging data.
- Clear diagnostic results categorized by dementia severity.
- Visual insights such as heatmaps highlighting affected brain regions.

Its intuitive design ensures efficient navigation and usability.

---

### **4. Advanced Visualization Tools**
NeuroScan includes tools to help interpret predictions:
- Heatmaps generated by ResNet50 highlight regions of interest in brain scans.
- Statistical charts summarize patient trends over time.
- Comparative analysis between scans monitors disease progression.

These tools empower healthcare professionals with actionable insights.

---

### **5. Admin Control Panel**
The admin portal supports system management tasks such as:
- Managing user accounts and permissions.
- Configuring system updates and settings.
- Ensuring compliance with healthcare standards for data security.

This feature allows administrators to maintain system integrity as the platform scales.

---

### **6. High Accuracy and Reliability**
The ResNet50 model has been trained on datasets like ADNI (Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative), ensuring:
- Robust performance across diverse imaging data.
- Minimal false positives or negatives in dementia detection.

NeuroScan's accuracy makes it a reliable tool for clinical use.

---

### **7. Scalable Design**
The platform is built to accommodate future expansions:
- Integration with additional datasets for improved accuracy across demographics.
- Support for non-imaging data like cognitive tests and patient history.
- Development of mobile applications for on-the-go diagnostics.

---

### **8. Privacy and Security**
NeuroScan adheres to strict privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA compliance) to ensure sensitive patient information remains secure. Encryption protocols safeguard all uploaded imaging data.

---

### **9. Continuous Model Improvement**
The ResNet50 model is designed for continuous improvement through automated retraining mechanisms using new datasets and user feedback, ensuring its predictions remain accurate over time.

---

## Technologies Used
NeuroScan is built using:
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
- **Programming Language**: Python.
- **Web Frameworks**: Flask/Django for backend development.
